# CLimate Analysis using Digital Estimations (CLAuDE)
This is the project to model the climates of hypothetical planets, which could be Earth with slightly different parameters or entirely alien worlds. 

The tool which we'll use to accomplish this is CLimate Analysis using Digital Estimations (CLAuDE), an intuitive, 
simplistic model of atmospheric dynamics.

**The purpose of CLAuDE is to be:**
- versatile, such that users customise which modules of code will be used in a given simulation
- a teaching tool, both for programming and climate physics
- accessible, designed to run even on basic machines with appropriate parameters

**Objectives**
- Modular, so users can customise the complexity of the model and write their own modules.
- To answer questions through YouTube videos about hypothetical planets, that would use the output of CLAuDE

Beyond these goals, we hope that it can become a useful resource for teachers and students discussing climate 
and atmospheric dynamics.

### Building
See the documentation on building in [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/Planet-Factory/claude/blob/master/BUILDING.md).

### Community

**Discord**

If you wish to discuss CLAuDE and other things related to climate and atmospheric dynamics, feel free 
to join the [Dr. Simon Clark Discord Server](https://discord.gg/SZu6e2F).

**YouTube**

Simon creates videos about climate and atmospheric dynamics, as well as videos hypothesising 
if fictional planets could be a reality, based of what we currently know. 

If you think you'd enjoy this videos, you can watch him [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRRr_xrOm66qaigIbwFLvbQ).

**Twitch**

CLAuDE is currently being developed on Wednesday [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/drsimonclark) streams every week!
